# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Two datasets are provided for Mechacars prototype vehicles


 - MechaCar_mpg.csv - Test results for 50 prototype MechaCars with multiple metrics.
 - Suspension_Coil.csv -  The weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

From the result Vehicle length and Ground clearence have a non-random effect on MPG of the MechaCar. 
- p-value: 5.35e-11 is lower than significance level of 0.05%  and the slope of the linear model is zero thus the null hypothesis must be rejected. . In other words, we can predict MPG using linear model with vehicle length and ground clearance values.
- Multiple R-squared: 0.7149 means that the regression model can approximate MPG with 71% accurate
